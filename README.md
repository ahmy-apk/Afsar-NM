# Healthcare Diagnostics and Treatment
This project presents an AI-powered healthcare assistant that aids in early diagnosis and treatment recommendation. By integrating machine learning, real-time vitals simulation, chatbot interfaces, and data visualization, it enables smarter healthcare decisions for both patients and practitioners.

🔑 Key Features

    🧠 Smart Diagnosis         – Predicts potential diseases based on simulated vitals and user input.
    💬 Chatbot Interface       – Interactive symptom checker and medical assistant chatbot.
    ⚠️ Risk Assessment         – Analyzes health parameters and identifies critical conditions.
    💊 Personalized Advice     – Suggests treatments, diet, and health recommendations using ML logic.
    📊 Data Visualization      – Produces bar charts, histograms, shaded plots, and Sankey diagrams.
    🌐 IoT Integration         – Simulates data from connected health monitoring devices.
    🔐 Data Security           – Simulated secure processing for health records.
    🔁 Feedback System         – Collects user feedback for improved predictions.

        - random           – Simulated vitals generation

⚙️ How It Works

    1. Simulated Vitals      – Generates random values for temperature, heart rate, BP, etc.
    2. User Input            – Patient answers health-related questions.
    3. ML Risk Prediction    – Model assesses disease probability and risk category.
    4. Visualization         – Graphs are displayed to interpret health status.
    5. Treatment Suggestion  – Based on predictions, suitable advice is shown.
    6. Feedback Loop         – User feedback helps improve system accuracy.
